            "New York Community Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for New York Community Bank, a New York State-chartered savings bank serving customers throughout Metro New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, and Arizona.  New York Community Bank is the largest thrift in the nation and one of the leading thrift depositories in most of the markets we serve. Our roots go back to 1859, when we were chartered by the State of New York in Queens, a borough of New York City. Since then, we have grown from a single branch in Flushing to 240 branch offices in five states!  In New York, we operate 130 branches of the Community Bank through five local divisions, reflecting the growth of our franchise through a series of mergers with other local thrifts: Queens County Savings Bank, with 31 branches in Queens County; Richmond County Savings Bank, with 20 banking offices on Staten Island; Roosevelt Savings Bank, with seven branches in Brooklyn, and Westchester County; our largest division, Roslyn Savings Bank, with 44 locations in Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island; and Atlantic Bank with 12 branches in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island; We also operate 16 branches directly under the name \"New York Community Bank\".  In New Jersey, we serve our customers through our Garden State Community Bank division, with 42 branches in Essex, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Union, and Ocean counties.  With the acquisition of the deposits and certain assets of AmTrust Bank in December 2009, we added two new divisions to our banking family: AmTrust Bank, which serves our customers in Florida and Arizona, and Ohio Savings Bank, which serves our customers through 28 branches in the Buckeye State. Our 26 branches in Florida are largely located in the state's southern and coastal counties, while our 14 branches in Arizona are primarily located in the central part of the state. Included in that network are three branches that were acquired in connection with our Desert Hills Bank transaction in March 2010.  We operate our branches with an emphasis on convenience, with 233 locations that feature 24-hour ATM banking, and 207 of our Community Bank branches open at least six days a week. We also offer our customers 24-hour access to their accounts with online banking, mobile banking, and banking by phone."
